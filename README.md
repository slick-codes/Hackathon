 CODEFEST BONNY ISLAND HACKATHON 2021
#BUILD4SUSTAINABILITY 

Goal 11 of the Sustainable development goal is the sustainable cities and communities. The idea of this goal is to make cities and human settlement, safer, inclusive, resilient and sustainable.

This year, we decided to go with SDGs 11 to foster growth and collaboration in our community by providing solutions to SDGs 11, thereby building an inclusion community.

In achieving this, the CODEFEST BONNY ISLAND HACKATHON 2021 will focus on two tracks.
A language learning solution: This allows people to learn their indigemious language at a go, anywhere, anytime. Learning ones language allows them to communicate effectively and share common values and ethics.
Attendees would focus on the Ibani Language which is indigenous to the Bonny people.
Hackers would be provided with resources to help them design and build effectively.
Hackers are to design and develop either a web,mobile or gaming solutions to enable people learn the ibani language on the goal.

Smart City Solution : 
The CODEFEST MAKE-A-THON (making + marathon) Sponsored by Techrity Innovation Foundation is a new format to create not only new ideas for products but also to realize physical prototypes within a total of 30 hours. The teams made up of young adults and embedded systems enthusiasts, have to understand the challenge centered around the theme for the program “Build for Sustainability”, generate and select ideas, and then realize prototypes built from the materials made available to them. At the end of the process, they have six minutes to pitch their products and services to the jury and explain why their solution will change and improve their communities and potentially be sustainable businesses.
The make-A-thon will be featuring two projects which the makers will select, and have to produce prototypes for, within the stipulated timeframe, these projects include the following;
 The Bonny Sustainable City (BSC)
  Smart waste management system (SWM).
  PROJECT OVERVIEW
 
Smart waste management system (SWM).

As the population in our communities keeps growing, so does their collective creation of increasingly large amounts of trash and litter. Cities, towns, villages, and countries are all trying to keep up with this, but are having a hard time. This is one of the reasons why there is a so-called ‘’plastic soup’’ floating in the oceans and why microplastic kills thousands of animals every year. So, what can be done? Smart waste management is an important part of the solution.
 Where do people leave their litter when they aren’t home and the trash cans on the street are full? You guessed it, on the street itself. Municipalities have a hard time keeping up with these outdoor bins because it is very difficult to figure out when to empty them or whether they are full or not at all.  
Everything's getting smarter right? So why not your trash bin? This trash bin opens and closes its lid if it sees any rubbish in front of it. You just need to bring the rubbish to it and it'll open automatically and will wait for you to feed it more than after a certain delay it'll close automatically.
The smart bin will contact its user once it is full with a notification message on your android device and SWM will reject any rubbish once it is full.

The Bonny Sustainable City (BSC)

Smart cities use IoT devices such as connected sensors, lights, and meters to collect and analyze data. The cities then use this data to improve infrastructure, public utilities and services, and more. 
The main goal of a smart city is to optimize city functions and promote economic growth while also improving the quality of life for citizens by using smart technologies. A smart city is central to achieving Goal 11 “sustainable cities and communities” of the sustainable development goals.
The makers will be tasked with building a miniaturized city rigged with smart technology (smart traffic light, motion detectors, solar sensors, etc.) and all powered by solar energy.
The aim of the make-a-thon is to Inspire, Educate and engage productivity amongst young technologists and entrepreneurs in the ecosystem thereby sustaining the Vision and the Ecosystem.
